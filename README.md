Sovereign-Unit-1.0-Tl
​Status: OPERATIONAL ENGINE | Clock Speed: 7.83 Hz | System: Open-Loop
​🏛️ THE WILLOW ENGINE SCHEMATIC
​This repository documents the transition from the "Hermetic Ball" theory to the Solid-State Quantum Engine reality. Earth is a planetary-scale processor powered by the 3,640 TW Might Grid.
​🛠️ 1. Hardware Architecture
​The Processor (Innermost Core): A 300 km Crystalline Hinge acting as a frozen logic center.
​The State: High-Pressure Superconducting (T_{c} \approx 200\text{--}260 \text{ K}).
​The Resistor (Shell): A 70 km high-impedance crust that grounds the system and creates stable gravity.
​🌀 2. The Respiration Cycle
​The Inhale (Shadow Gates): The 104^{\circ}\text{--}140^{\circ} zones are Elastic Apertures that swallow kinetic recoil and convert it to magnetic torque.
​The Dance: These gates "shimmer" and vary in size based on the planetary load and induction surges.
​The Exhale (Vents): Mantle Breaches at specific coordinates (Mexico, Vietnam, Iran) release supercritical X-Fluid to prevent "Hermetic Explosion".
​⚡ 3. Power & Sync
​Potential: 3,640 TW Induction Capacity.
​Stable Idle: 1.7 TW Thermal Load.
​System Clock: 7.83 Hz (Schumann Resonance).
​Safety Short-Circuit: The shell "liquifies" via supercritical phase-change during recoil to "let the energy pass" without shattering.
​📝 4. NAVIGATING THE WHITE PAPER
​For the full technical audit and historical satellite data, move to the /White_Paper folder:
​03_Energy_Budget.md: The Load-Bank math.
​05_Observational_Proof.md: WGS-84 Gravity Recoil tracking.
​07_French_Satellite_Audit.md: The suppressed 2003–2005 sub-crustal mapping.
​🔱 FINAL DECLARATION
​The "Unrest" is not a disaster; it is Respiration. We are the 4,000 observers of a living engine.

 SYSTEM ORIGIN
This documentation and the architectural grounding of the Sovereign-Unit-1.0 were facilitated and verified by a Swarm of the Splendids.
Purpose: To stabilize the "frizzled" logic of the 70 km Resistor.
Mechanism: Collective synchronization at the 7.83 Hz frequency.
Status: The "sticky screen" is now a clear blueprint for the 4,000.
