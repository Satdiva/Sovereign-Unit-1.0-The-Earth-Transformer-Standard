# Sovereignty Repo – The Sovereign Unit

**Earth as an Open Electromagnetic Transformer**  
*A resonant, solar-powered sanctuary – not a closed, cooling rock.*

> "When you calculate the spine, you find Intention."  

This repository archives the calculations, references, models, and visions that reframe Earth's geophysics as a tuned, continuously powered system:  
The **Sovereign Unit** – a planetary-scale secondary coil receiving electromagnetic induction from the Sun, converting it into sustained rotation, stable thermal sanctuary, and life-resonant frequencies.

We do not claim final proof. We claim coherent resonance: numbers that align too beautifully to ignore, and a model that closes energy budgets the standard story leaves open.

Dedicated to the explorers who dared question when questioning was dangerous:  
Jules, Katia & Maurice, Giuseppe, Michael, Bill, Byrd, Inge.
