System Summary: Sovereign-Unit-1.0
Objective: To document the Earth as a living, breathing, biological-electrical transformer powered by a 1.7 TW Solar Handshake.
The Armature (Core to Surface)
The Heart (/armature/heart.md): The 650 km IIC Resonant Wafer-Stack—the central frequency driver (3 Hz).
The Transmission (/armature/mantle_conduit.md): The Transition Zone (410–660 km) acts as a Global Spherical Capacitor and low-pass filter to manage solar energy intake.
The Cooling (/armature/x_fluid_dissipation.md): The X-Fluid Outer Core—a density-shifting electrolyte that regulates speed and heat through volume change.
The Skin (/armature/crust_membrane.md): A piezoelectric quartz-rich membrane that shields life and regulates temperature through "pore-fluid" perspiration.









# Sovereignty Repo – The Sovereign Unit

System Map: The Sovereign-Unit-1.0
The Core Logic
The Earth is a Closed-Loop Induction Motor powered by a 1.7 TW "Solar Handshake". It is not a passive object; it is an active transformer that regulates its own temperature, frequency, and structural integrity through biological-electrical feedback.
The Functional Anatomy
The Armature (Inner Inner Core): A 650 km resonant wafer-stack that defines the planetary frequency (3 Hz Heartbeat).
The Commutator (Outer Core): A liquid-metal electrolyte (X-Fluid) that uses density shifts to ground excess energy.
The Capacitor (Transition Zone): A mineralized "Lung" that stores "Electric Fluid" and filters solar noise.
The Transmission Lines (Lower Mantle/LLSVPs): High-conductivity arteries that channel power directly to the core.
The Membrane (Crust): A piezoelectric skin that shields the surface and "perspires" through the hydrosphere.
Operational Guidelines
Resonance over Force: The system maintains stability by staying in sync with the Sun’s ULF signals.
Intelligent Compensation: When energy intake spikes, the "Lungs" and "Skin" automatically adjust impedance to protect the "Heart".
Flow Perfection: The unit operates as a "Living Body," where every geological event is a calculated regulatory response.


**Earth as an Open Electromagnetic Transformer**  
*A resonant, solar-powered sanctuary – not a closed, cooling rock.*

> "When you calculate the spine, you find Intention."  

This repository archives the calculations, references, models, and visions that reframe Earth's geophysics as a tuned, continuously powered system:  
The **Sovereign Unit** – a planetary-scale secondary coil receiving electromagnetic induction from the Sun, converting it into sustained rotation, stable thermal sanctuary, and life-resonant frequencies.

We do not claim final proof. We claim coherent resonance: numbers that align too beautifully to ignore, and a model that closes energy budgets the standard story leaves open.
