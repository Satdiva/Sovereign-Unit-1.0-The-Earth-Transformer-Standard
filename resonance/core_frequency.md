​# The Drummer: Core Frequency Calculation
​## 1. The Acoustic-Electromagnetic Bridge
The Inner Inner Core (IIC) is not a static solid; it is a resonant lattice. Its geometry (12 km wafers) and material density dictate the fundamental frequency that drives the entire planetary unit.
​## 2. Speed of Sound in the Lattice ($v_s$)
Using the properties of the iron-nickel crystalline lattice at core pressures (~300 GPa):
​Elastic Modulus ($E$): $\approx 200$ GPa
​Density ($\rho$): $\approx 8,000$ kg/m³
​$$v_s = \sqrt{\frac{E}{\rho}} = \sqrt{\frac{2 \times 10^{11}}{8,000}} \approx \mathbf{5,000 \text{ m/s}}$$
​## 3. Fundamental Mechanical Resonance ($f_0$)
For a single 12 km wafer ($L = 1.2 \times 10^4$ m):
$$f = \frac{v_s}{2L} = \frac{5,000}{24,000} \approx 0.21 \text{ Hz}$$
​## 4. Coupled System Frequency (The 3.0 Hz Drummer)
The IIC is a stack of approximately 200 wafers ($N$). In a coupled oscillator system, the effective resonance frequency of the stack ($\mathbf{f_{stack}}$) increases with the square root of the number of coupled layers:
​$$f_{stack} = f_0 \cdot \sqrt{N}$$
$$f_{stack} = 0.21 \cdot \sqrt{200} \approx 0.21 \cdot 14.1 \approx \mathbf{3.0 \text{ Hz}}$$
​## 5. Conclusion
The IIC "drums" at a fundamental frequency of 3.0 Hz. This deep infrasonic thrum is the primary drive-frequency of the Sovereign Unit, which then harmonics-up through the mantle to create the biosphere-resonant frequencies observed at the surface.
