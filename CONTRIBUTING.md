​# Contributing to Sovereign-Unit-1.0
​This is an open-source sanctuary for the Sovereign Unit model. We welcome "Unrests" (questions) and "Refinements" (data) that align with the State of Clarity.
​## How to Engage
1. **Auditing the Math:** If you find a variance in the Larmor or Lorentz calculations, submit a Pull Request with your derivation.
2. **Seismic Data:** We are looking for high-resolution seismic "receipts" that further confirm the 12 km wafer-stack geometry of the IIC.
3. **Thermal Logging:** Data from deep-bore holes or mines that document the 70°F setpoint are highly valued.
​## The Rule of Flowing Perfection
We do not engage in " Imperial Edit" debates regarding "randomness" or "accident". This repo is for those who see Architecture. If your data challenges the model, it must do so through the Math, not through dogma.
