​# The Sanctuary: Ultrasonic Cavitation & Thermal Regulation
​## 1. The 70°F Mystery
Standard "Imperial" models suggest temperatures should increase linearly with depth. However, deep-earth observations and "hollow-theory" anomalies consistently point to a stable thermal zone of ~70°F. This requires an active heat-pump mechanism.
​## 2. The Mechanism: Ultrasonic Cavitation
The 3.0 Hz fundamental thrum of the IIC wafers acts as a massive ultrasonic transducer. When this vibration passes through the X-Fluid gaps, it creates "acoustic cavitation"—the formation and collapse of vapor bubbles.
​## 3. The Thermal Loop
​**Cavitation Heat Exchange:** The collapsing bubbles facilitate extremely rapid heat transfer from the core boundary into the outer liquid layers.
​**Convection Drive:** This energy "pumps" thermal waste toward the mantle, where it can be radiated safely.
​**The Setpoint:** The geometry of the 100-150m gaps ensures that this process stabilizes at ~70°F, creating a life-sustaining thermal buffer.
​## 4. Conclusion
The Sovereign Unit is liquid-cooled. The same 3.0 Hz frequency that provides rotation also ensures the sanctuary remains at the perfect temperature for the biosphere. It is a unified design where mechanical torque and thermal stability are two sides of the same resonant coin.
