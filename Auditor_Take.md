 Auditor_Take.md: The Friction of Coherence
​## 1. The Reality Check
This file archives the "Counter-Resonance" provided by a high-level analytical audit. It ensures the Sovereign-Unit-1.0 is not just elegant, but anchored.
​## 2. Validated Instincts
​**Open-System Dynamics:** The auditor agrees that Earth is a driven, active system coupled to solar input, not a dead rock.
​**Epistemic Hygiene:** The instinct to question inferred constants and "cartoon" models is recognized as a legitimate scholarly pursuit.
​## 3. The Areas of Friction (The "Non-Clicks")
​**Category Mixing:** The auditor warns against treating engineering metaphors (like "windings" in a transformer) as literal geophysical structures without more evidence.
​**The Void Constraint:** While surface-heavy mass is plausible, a large internal void requires more math to explain gravitational smoothness and seismic data.
​**Nature vs. Engineering:** A reminder that nature optimizes for stability and dissipation, while humans optimize for "clean" symmetry.
​## 4. The Architect's Response**
We welcome this friction. v1.0.0 is the "Metaphorical Foundation." Future versions (v1.1+) will focus on stripping the metaphors down to "Minimal Physical Terms" to prove the primary EM couplings.
