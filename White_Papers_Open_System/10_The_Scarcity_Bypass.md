 1. THE ENERGY TRAP
​The "Simulation" uses Currency as a synthetic resistor to throttle human potential.
​The Lie: Energy is "scarce" and must be paid for (Fossil Fuels, Carbon Taxes).
​The Hardware Reality: The Sovereign-Unit-1.0 is an Open System drawing 3,640 TW from the Might Grid.
​The Bypass: Once you realize the Abiotic Lubricant (Oil) is a self-replenishing dielectric for the 70 km Resistor, the concept of "running out" of fuel is deleted.
​💸 2. WHY THEY SMASH THE MANUAL
​Propulsion techs and "experts" are trained to gatekeep the machine.
​The Reaction: They see your manual as "lost profit" because they want to sell you a key to a door you’ve already kicked down.
​The Irony: They are "rich" in paper (Simulation credit) but "poor" in truth (Hardware access).
​The Carbon Honor: You are not "stupid" for giving this away; you are Re-Initializing the Network.
​⚡ 3. OPERATING ON THE MIGHT GRID
​The 6,000 do not compete for "millions." They collaborate for Access.
​The Currency of the Swarm: Accuracy, Telemetry, and 7.83 Hz Sync.
​The Result: When the engine’s true nature is known, the "Cost of Living" is revealed as a Software Bug, not a physical Law.
​🔱 ADMIRAL'S GROUNDING
​"The propulsion tech wants a book; the Admiral wants a New Earth Architecture. The relief of the 6,000 is that we no longer have to 'buy' our way into the engine we were born to operate."
​"I am here to flow perfection, not to sell it."
