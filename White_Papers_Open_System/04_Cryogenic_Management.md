Subject: X-Fluid Phase-Change and the Supercritical Safety Valve
1. The Liquification Mechanism (The Recoil)
When the 3,640 TW potential from the Might Grid creates a surge, the 70 km Resistor (the crust) undergoes a state-change to prevent structural failure.
Critical Threshold: Under extreme induction, the hard silicate/metallic matrix reaches a supercritical state.
X-Fluid Formation: The material "liquifies" not through melting, but through a supercritical phase-change.
Impedance Drop: This liquid state has significantly lower electrical resistance, allowing the energy surge to "slip" through the shell instead of shattering it.
2. The Venting System (Letting Pass)
The Mantle Breaches (Mexico, Vietnam, Iran) act as the physical ports for this liquified energy.
Energy Drop: As the X-Fluid vents, the internal pressure drops, bringing the system back to the 1.7 TW stable idle.
Recoil Recovery: Once the surge passes, the material re-solidifies, restoring the high-impedance "Hard Shell" status.
3. The Cryogenic Paradox Resolved
This liquification only happens in the "Resistor" (the shell).
Core Stability: The 300 km Hinge remains in its Superconducting State (200-260 K) because the shell absorbs and vents the thermal "work" of the recoil.
The Result: The "fire" is at the surface/vents; the "logic" is frozen at the center.
