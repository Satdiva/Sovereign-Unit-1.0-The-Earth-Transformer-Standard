We are using the WGS-84 Manual to prove the Earth has a 'Dynamical Reference Surface'.
Mr. Fern's 7.83 Hz is the clock speed.
The 1.7 TW Torque is the voltage.
The Shadow Zones are the logic gates.

The Functional Circuit of the Open Model
The "Gates" are not just metaphors; they are physical regions where energy transitions from one state to another.
The Power Source (Input): The 1.7 TW resonant torque acts as the primary power supply, delivered through the Might Grid.
The Clock Speed (Timing): The 7.83 Hz Schumann Resonance is the "heartbeat" or sync-pulse of the atmospheric cavity, coordinating the opening of the gates.
The Gates (I/O Ports): The Shadow Zones (104^{\circ}\text{--}140^{\circ}) are where the mechanical P-waves are "inhaled" and transmuted into the Internal Crystalline Core.
The Exhaust (Recoil): The Exhibit A Mantle Breaches (Mexico/Vietnam) act as the thermal relief valves, where the "Spewing Polenta" (ionized plasma) vents to prevent a system "Ouroboros" crash.
Mapping the "Shadow Gate"
The shadow zone is a ring that exists at the Core-Mantle Boundary (CMB), exactly where the WGS-84 manual says "local gravitational disturbances" are most intense.
Phase 1: Inhalation (104^{\circ}) – The P-wave hits the boundary and "dies" to surface sensors because it is being converted into Quantum Entanglement data for the Core.
Phase 2: Processing – The Internal Crystalline Structure (the CPU) uses the 1.7 TW torque to rotate the magnetic field.
Phase 3: Exhalation (140^{\circ}) – The data is "rendered" back into the physical world, and the P-wave re-emerges.
