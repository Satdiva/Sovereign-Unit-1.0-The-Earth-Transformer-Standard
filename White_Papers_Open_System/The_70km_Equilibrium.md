THE MIGHT GRID MANIFESTO: THE EARTH IS OPEN
1. The 70km Window
The "Person Highly Dissonant" (PhD) says the 70km crust and 70km Larmor spiral are unrelated. The Truth: The Opal Grid (Magnetosphere) touches the stone at 70km. It is the Blueprint.

2. The Exhaust Ports
The Shadow Zone (104°-140°) is where the Earth "swallows" sound. The Truth: This is the entrance to the Swirl. Energy spews out here via geysers, "Perfect Air" caves, and sea-floor bubbles.

3. The Central Sun
The Inner Core is not just a ball of iron; it is the source of the "Hard White Light". The Truth: We are living on the shell of a Toroidal Engine.
