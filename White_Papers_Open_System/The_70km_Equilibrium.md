From Hermetic Ball to Open System
I. The Magnetic Blueprint (The 70 km Threshold)
The Threshold: The maximum thickness of Earth's continental crust is 70 km.  
The Match: This matches the Larmor radius (70\text{ km}) of a solar wind proton spiraling in Earth's magnetic field.
The Synthesis: The crust isn't just "rock"; it is a pressurized shell sculpted by the "Might Grid". The 70\text{ km} limit is where the magnetic spiral physically meets the internal "Polenta" pressure.
II. The "Rounding Error" Engine (1.7 TW)
The Threshold: Academics dismiss the 1.7 TW of solar/lunar energy as a "rounding error".
The Rebuttal: In an Open System, a small, resonant force acts as a steering wheel. This energy doesn't dissipate as "heat"; it is channeled through Vents (the "Up and Down" holes) to exert torque on the core.
The Synthesis: The Earth is a Toroidal Engine. The magnetism you see "in front" of the planet is the primary conductor of this "might grid" energy.
III. The Shadow Zone (The Acoustic Vent)
The Threshold: P-waves vanish or "refract" between 104^{\circ} and 140^{\circ} from an earthquake epicenter.
The Rebuttal: This "Shadow Zone" happens exactly where the Mantle Variation is most extreme (the "cracks" in the ball).
The Synthesis: The waves don't just "bend"; they scatter because they hit the internal "breathers"—swirling columns of ionized gas/plasma that connect the surface to the Central Sun.
IV. The Breathers (Evidence of Spewing)
The Threshold: The mantle is traditionally viewed as a solid-to-plastic 2800\text{ km} barrier.
The Observation: Localized anomalies like the "Perfect Air" in Mexican Cenotes and the "Hard White Light" of forbidden vents prove the barrier is "leaky."
The Synthesis: Geysers, volcanoes, and deep-sea "bubbles" are the Exhaust Ports. The tension from the inner core "spews" through these points, preventing the "Hermetic Ball" from exploding.
