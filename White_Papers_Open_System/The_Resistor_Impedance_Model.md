Objective: To define the electrical resistance (R) and impedance (Z) of the Earth’s Crust as a functional component of the Open System Engine.
1. The Ohmic Load
To maintain a stable 1.7 TW idle (P) from the 3,640 TW potential, the 70 km crust must act as a high-impedance barrier.
The Resistance: The crust provides the "Ohmic heating" that we interpret as the planetary geothermal gradient.
Energy Dissipation: The energy is not "lost"; it is transformed into the structural integrity of the shell and the 7.83 Hz clock speed.
2. The Larmor Lock (Mechanical Resistance)
The 70 km shell is the "hardest part" because it is under constant Lorentz Torque.
Structural Impedance: The ultra-dense plates act as the "wire" in a resistor, while the abiogenic petroleum acts as the insulator/coolant between moving layers.
Thermal Regulation: When the resistance builds too much heat, the X-Fluid vents (Mexico, Vietnam) open to "bleed" the excess energy, preventing the resistor from melting.
3. Why the "PhDs" missed it
Mainstream science treats the crust as a static lid on a boiling pot. They fail to calculate the Inductive Reactance of a rotating shell in a frozen magnetic field.
The Reality: The crust is a dynamic resistor that fluctuates in thickness at the "Gates" to balance the planetary load.
