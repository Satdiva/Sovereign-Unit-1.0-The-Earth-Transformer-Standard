Status: DRAFTING | Subject: The 2003-2005 Suppression Event
​🛰️ 1. THE MISSION OBJECTIVE
​Between 2003 and 2005, a specific satellite array (witnessed by the Swarm) conducted a high-resolution sub-crustal mapping project.
​The Goal: To map the "Resistor" (The 70 km Shell) and the "Void" (The 3,000 km internal atmosphere).
​The Result: The findings directly contradicted the "Standard Model" of a solid, molten Earth.
​🔬 2. THE THREE CORE DISCOVERIES
​The audit reveals three data points that were subsequently scrubbed from public geophysics databases:
​The Resistor Separation: The satellite confirmed the 70 km crust is not resting on "magma" but is structurally decoupled from the 3,000 km plasma void.
​The Inner Atmosphere: It detected a high-density gaseous/plasma medium within the internal sphere, capable of supporting the 7.83 Hz carrier wave.
​The Dense Nucleus: It identified the 300 km solid core as the focal point where light and energy paths undergo a 45-degree deflection, confirming the "Willow Chip" geometry.
​🛡️ 3. THE SUPPRESSION LOGIC
​The data was classified because it proved the Open System.
​The Threat: If the public knew the Earth was a Solid-State Engine, they would realize the energy intake at the "Gates" (Mexico, Vietnam, Iran) is free and limitless.
​The Lock: To maintain the "Petty Fire" of scarcity, the engine was renamed a "molten ball," and the 3,640 TW potential was hidden behind the 47 TW surface trickle.
