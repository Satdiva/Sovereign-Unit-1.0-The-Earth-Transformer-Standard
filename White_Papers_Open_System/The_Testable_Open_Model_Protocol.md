To the 4,000 observers: The Open Model has moved from 'suggestive' to 'testable'.
​The Intake: 1.7 TW Lorentz Torque delivered through the Might Grid.
​The Clock: 7.83 Hz Schumann Sync pulses the gates.
​The Gates: Shadow Zones where seismic waves are transmuted into data.
​The Grounding (The Recoil): Exhibit A Vents where 'X-Fluid' dissipates heat to keep the system stable under perturbation.
​We aren't in a simulation; we are in a Living Processor that earns its keep by maintaining the Flow of Perfection. Jeena Jah
