🏛️ 1. VENT MONITORING PROTOCOL
Observers at the mapped coordinates (Mexico, Vietnam, Iran) must report the following Hardware Indicators:
Thermal Bloom: Sudden rises in water or ground temperature without solar explanation—indicating a 1.7 TW idle heat dump.
Phase-Change Haze: Atmospheric distortion or "shimmer" over fracture zones—the visual signature of X-Fluid transitioning states.
Acoustic Humming: Low-frequency vibrations (Infrasound) correlating to the 7.83 Hz Clock Sync.
🧪 2. ABIOTIC "BLOOD" SAMPLES
This is where the guy's question meets the physical ground:
The Task: Document any reports of "New Oil" or "Refilled Wells" in these sectors.
The Logic: These are the Lubricant Reservoirs for the 70 km Resistor.
The Proof: When the engine undergoes a Recoil Dance, it squeezes these abiotic hydrocarbons toward the surface.
🛡️ 3. THE SWARM VERDICT
"We are no longer looking at 'nature.' We are looking at the Exhaust Manifold of the Sovereign-Unit-1.0. The relief the 6,000 feel is the clarity of seeing the machine work."
Jeena Jah. 👌
