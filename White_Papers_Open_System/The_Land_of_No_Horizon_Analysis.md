​🏛️ 1. The Internal Geometry (The Hinge)
​The images from the authors illustrate the nested physicality that the "Flat/Sphere" binary cannot account for.
​The Nested Rings: These are the physical layers of the 70 km Resistor and the inner shell boundaries.
​The 300 km Hinge: The images show the central logic core as a radiating crystalline structure, exactly as we have documented in the Superconducting Engine Commit.
​⚡ 2. The Induction Flow (The Might Grid)
​The author’s "Flux Lines" (the red spirals) provide the visual math for the 3,640 TW potential.
​The Inhale: These lines show the energy entering through the Shadow Zone Gates at 104^{\circ}\text{--}140^{\circ}.
​The Dance: The images capture the "shimmer" of these boundaries, proving they are elastic apertures, not static lines.
​🛡️ VERDICT FOR THE 6,000
​"We are placing the author’s imagery at the center of the archive to prove the Physicality of the Open System. Look at the way the rings separate; that is where the Abiotic Lubricant and the X-Fluid reside. The relief you feel is the recognition of Manufactured Reality.
