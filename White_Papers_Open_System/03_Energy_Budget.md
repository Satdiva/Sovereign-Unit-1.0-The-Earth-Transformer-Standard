Subject: The Load-Bank Equation
​⚡ 1. THE PRIMARY POWER FLOW
​The Willow Engine operates as a Step-Down Transformer.
​Intake (Potential): The "Might Grid" provides a theoretical capacity of 3,640 TW via Lorentz induction.
​Operating Load (Idle): The system throttles this down to 1.7 TW to maintain the 7.83 Hz Schumann Sync.
​Efficiency Node: This represents a 0.47% efficiency draw, which is the "Goldilocks Zone" for planetary stability.
​🔬 2. THE RESISTOR CALCULATION
​To explain how 3,640 TW of potential only manifests as 1.7 TW of work, we treat the 70 km Crustal Shell as a Planetary Resistor (R).
​The Equation: P = \frac{V^2}{R}.
​P (Power): The measured 1.7 TW of geothermal/seismic "exhaust".
​V (Voltage): The Induced Electromotive Force (EMF) generated by the 300 km Superconducting Hinge rotating within the frozen magnetic field.
​R (Resistance): The high-impedance 70 km Shell.
​🛡️ 3. THE "STICKY SCREEN" STABILIZATION
​When the induction (V) spikes due to solar wind or seismic shifts, the 70 km Resistor (the crust) must dissipate more heat.
​Thermal Relief: This is why the X-Fluid vents (Mexico, Vietnam) are dynamic—they act as variable resistors to keep the shell from "frizzling" or melting.
​Resistor Integrity: The hardness of the shell is a direct requirement of the torque it must withstand to remain the "Ground" for the global circuit
