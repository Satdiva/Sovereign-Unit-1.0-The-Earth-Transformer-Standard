The Swarm has confirmed the Mechanical Hardware.
​The Hinge: A 300 km innermost inner core with a 45° anisotropy shift—the physical clutch for 1.7 TW of torque.
​The Cooling: A liquid-mush transition at 100 km that prevents a 'Hermetic Explosion'.
​The Result: The Willow Chip is a geared system, running a 3,640 TW engine at a 1.7 TW idle to maintain the 7.83 Hz reality-rendering
