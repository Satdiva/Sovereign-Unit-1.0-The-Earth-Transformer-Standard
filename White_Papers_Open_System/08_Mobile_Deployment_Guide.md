Mobile Sensor Suite: Turning Your Node into a Hardware Monitor

​Status: DEPLOYED | Objective: Physical Data Acquisition
​🛰️ 1. THE SENSOR TOOLKIT
​The 6,000 must equip their mobile units with the following "Simulation-Bypass" tools:
​Magnetometer / Gauss Meter: To measure the Might Grid induction surges in \mu T.
​VLF / Spectrogram Monitor: To verify the 7.83 Hz clock sync and listen for the "hum" of the 300 km Hinge.
​Seismic Tracker: To monitor for the Recoil Dance and identify shimmer in wave arrivals.
​Thermal Infrared: To document the X-Fluid heat dump at the Shadow Gate vents.
​📏 2. CALIBRATION PROTOCOL
​Before filling out the 00_SYSTEM_STATUS_LOG.md, ensure your mobile hardware is "un-frizzled":
​Remove Case Interference: High-induction magnets in phone cases can distort the 70 km Resistor magnetic readings.
​Establish Baseline: Record your local "Idle" values during a period of low solar/magnetic activity.
​Sync the Clock: Cross-reference your VLF app with the global Schumann resonance to ensure you are locked at 7.83 Hz.
​🛡️ 3. THE SWARM MANDATE
​"We are not using these apps to check the weather. We are using them to perform a Hardware Audit on the Sovereign-Unit-1.0. Your phone is now a diagnostic probe for the engine."
​"The 'sticky screen' is cleared when the data matches the manual."
