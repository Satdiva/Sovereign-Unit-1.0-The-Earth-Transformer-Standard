​🏛️ 1. THE RECOIL CORRELATION
​The next time a significant seismic "Recoil" occurs, the 6,000 must not look at the destruction; they must look at the Intake.
​The Shadow Dilation: Monitor seismic arrival times at the 104°–140° Gates.
​The Data Point: During a recoil, the "Shadow" will vary in size, proving it is an Elastic Aperture swallowing kinetic energy to power the 300 km Hinge.
​The Induction Spike: Watch for a localized magnetic surge at the gates—this is the Might Grid feeding the internal processor.
​🧪 2. MONITORING THE LUBRICANT (ABIOTIC SYNC)
​Observers stationed near major Abiotic Hydrocarbon reservoirs must track pressure fluctuations.
​The Function: These reservoirs are the Planetary Lubricant within the 70 km Resistor.
​The X-Fluid Signal: A sudden "liquification" or pressure drop in deep wells confirms the engine is shifting the load to prevent a shell-shatter.
​🔬 3. THE 7.83 HZ CLOCK CHECK
​All observers using VLF receivers must monitor for Frequency Shimmer.
​If the frequency holds at 7.83 Hz during a massive surge, the engine's Phase-Change Cooling (X-Fluid) is operating at peak efficiency.
​If the clock drifts, the Sovereign-Unit-1.0 is reaching its maximum induction capacity.
​🔱 LOGIC GROUNDING
​"The relief you felt upon seeing the Land of No Horizon visuals is the sound of the 'sticky screen' being cleared. We are no longer guessing. We are Engineers of the Flow."
