The 70km Equilibrium: Exhibit A
​File: The_70km_Equilibrium.md
​I. The Definition of Exhibit A
​Exhibit A is the physical proof that the Earth’s mantle is not a hermetic, solid wall, but a variable shield with specific Breaches.
​The Constant: The maximum thickness of the continental crust is 70\text{ km}.
​The Connection: This matches the Larmor Radius (70\text{ km}) of solar protons spiraling within the Earth's magnetic field.
​II. The Mantle Breach Locations
​The "Huge Variation" in the mantle creates the Breach. Where the mantle thins to meet this 70\text{ km} threshold, the "Might Grid" can "touch" the internal "Polenta" pressure.
​Marine Vents: At oceanic ridges, the crust thins to roughly 5\text{--}10\text{ km}, creating a massive breach for energy dissipation.
​Continental Windows: In specific "Forbidden" locations like the deep caves of Vietnam or the Mexican Cenotes, the mantle variation allows the Central Sun energy to reach the surface as "Hard White Light".
​III. The "Rounding Error" Power
​The PhD claims 1.7\text{ TW} is too small to matter.
​The Smash: In an Open System, the Lorentz Force (F = J \times B) acts specifically at these Exhibit A breach points.
​The Result: The energy isn't "lost"; it is the resonant torque that drives the "Swirl" within the Shadow Zone.


Exhibit A: Global Mantle Breach Evidence
Objective: To document the specific coordinates where the "Hermetic Ball" is compromised by the "Open System".
1. The Afar Triangle (Ethiopia)
Breach Type: Triple Junction Vent.
Crustal Depth: Approximately 20\text{ km}.
The Clarity: This is a major "Up and Down" hole where the mantle is nearly exposed, allowing the "Might Grid" to plug directly into the internal engine.
2. Yucatán Peninsula (Mexico)
Breach Type: Cenote Grid (Craton Edge).
Crustal Depth: Approximately 30\text{ km}.
The Clarity: Site of the "Green Scintillation" and direct atmospheric exchange with the interior.
3. Son Doong (Vietnam)
Breach Type: Limestone Window.
Crustal Depth: Approximately 25\text{--}30\text{ km}.
The Clarity: A primary observation point for the "Hard White Light" emanating from the Central Sun.
4. The Marianas Trench (Pacific Ocean)
Breach Type: Subduction Sluice.
Crustal Depth: Less than 10\text{ km}.
The Clarity: Acts as the primary "Drain" or intake for the Shadow Zone Swirl (104^{\circ}–140^{\circ}).
5. Iceland (Mid-Atlantic Ridge)
Breach Type: Ridge Exhaust Port.
Crustal Depth: Less than 15\text{ km}.
The Clarity: A surface manifestation of the "Spewing Polenta" where the internal pressure meets the atmosphere.
