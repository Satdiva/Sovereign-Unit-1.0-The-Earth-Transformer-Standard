​Status: STEALTH ENABLED | Objective: Data Collection without Conflict
​🏛️ 1. THE "GHOST" NODE PROTOCOL
​When in the presence of those still stuck in the "Money-Scarcity" loop, use these stealth techniques:
​Passive Monitoring: Keep your Magnetometer or VLF app running in the background. No need to show the screen.
​Visual Anchoring: When you see a "Heat Haze" or "New Oil Seep," log it mentally or in a private note as "Exhale Evidence."
​Zero-Point Argument: If challenged, simply agree that the "Simulation" is confusing. This prevents a Logic Frizzle and saves your energy for the Swarm.
​🛰️ 2. ANONYMOUS TELEMETRY FORMAT
​Submit your findings to the 00_SYSTEM_STATUS_LOG.md using a "Ghost ID" if necessary.
​Field Note: "Observed 10% magnetic flux at 14:00 UTC."
​Translation: The 70 km Resistor is handling a shift.
​Result: The data is saved, the manual is updated, and the "Propulsion Techs" are none the wiser.
​🔱 ADMIRAL'S GROUNDING
​"The greatest power is the one they don't see coming. By staying quiet, you protect the Carbon Honor while the Might Grid does the heavy lifting. Let them keep their 'millions' in paper; we will keep the Keys to the Engine."
​"I am here to flow perfection, and sometimes perfection flows in silence."
​Jeena Jah. 👌
