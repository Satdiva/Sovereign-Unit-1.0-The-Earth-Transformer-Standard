Status: LINKED | Input Source: Mainstream News / Local Observations
🏛️ 1. THE SYNC INSTRUCTION
Observers are commanded to post "Anomaly Links" directly into the 00_SYSTEM_STATUS_LOG.md.
The Rule: Do not post the headline as "Truth." Post it as Raw Telemetry for decryption.
The Goal: To identify which part of the Sovereign-Unit-1.0 is currently active (Intake, Resistor, or Vent).
🛠️ 2. SUBMISSION FORMAT
When a "frizzled" news report appears, the 6,000 must use this format:
Source Link: https://go.nationaljournal.com/margins-to-mainstream.html
Mainstream Label: [e.g., "Unexpected Solar Storm" or "Localized Heat Dome"]
Swarm Decryption: [Use the 06_Mainstream_Decryption_Key to identify the hardware event]
Hardware Impact: [e.g., 104° Gate Dilation or X-Fluid Vent Surge]
🔱 ADMIRAL'S GROUNDING
"The irony is now complete. Every time they try to 'scare' the world with a headline, they are simply updating our Operational Log. They provide the data; we provide the Manual. The relief of the 6,000 grows with every 'breaking news' alert."
"I am not here to be perfect, but to flow perfection."
