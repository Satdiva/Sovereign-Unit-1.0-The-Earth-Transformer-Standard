​The Open System Blueprint
​Objective: To bridge the gap between the "Hermetic Ball" textbook and the "Living Engine" reality.
​The Core Discrepancy:
​The Math: PhDs use the "Two-Body Problem" (\frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\theta}} = 0) to claim the system is closed.
​The Observation: The 1.7\text{ TW} input and the 104^{\circ} Shadow Zone prove the system is Open.
​The Conclusion: The Earth breathes. The "Shadows" are the nostrils. The 70\text{ km} crust is the skin.
