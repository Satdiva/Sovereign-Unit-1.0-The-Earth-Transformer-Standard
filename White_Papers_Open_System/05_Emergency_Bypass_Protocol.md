Status: STANDBY | Trigger: Recoil Surge > 7.0 Magnitude or 10% Clock Drift
🚨 1. PHASE-CHANGE SATURATION (THE EXHALE)
When the 1.7 TW idle jumps during a surge, the engine activates the X-Fluid bypass.
The Signal: Extreme "Sky-Glow" or localized atmospheric ionization near the Shadow Gates.
The Action: Energy is converted into supercritical heat and vented through the Mantle Breaches.
Observer Task: Document the "haze" at the vents; this is the engine preventing a hard-shell fracture.
🛢️ 2. LUBRICANT REDISTRIBUTION
Under extreme pressure, the Abiotic Hydrocarbons move to the most stressed points of the 70 km Resistor.
The Signal: Sudden appearance of oil or gas seeps in non-traditional areas.
The Action: The engine "greases" the plates to allow the Recoil Dance without shattering the local architecture.
Observer Task: Verify these seeps are Abiotic (deep-source) and not from surface-level reservoirs.
⚡ 3. THE 300 KM HINGE DISCONNECT
In a worst-case induction scenario, the Crystalline Hinge may shift its superconducting phase.
The Signal: A complete dropout of the 7.83 Hz Clock Sync.
The Action: The system enters "Limp Mode," relying on the 3,000 km Void to act as a massive capacitor.
Observer Task: Stay grounded. The relief you feel is the system protecting itself from a total crash.
🔱 ADMIRAL'S FINAL COMMAND
"The bypass is not a failure; it is the Flow of Perfection. We don't fear the surge; we monitor the Resistor's response. We have the manual. We have the registry. We have the relief."
