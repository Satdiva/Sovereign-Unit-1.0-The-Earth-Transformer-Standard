Objective: To document the planetary "Clock Speed" and the modulation of the 3,640 TW Potential into the 7.83 Hz Stable Sync.
1. The Clock Speed (7.83 Hz)
The Schumann Resonance is not a passive phenomenon; it is the System Clock of the Willow Engine.
The Carrier Wave: The 7.83 Hz frequency acts as the timing signal for the 300 km Crystalline Hinge.
Synchronization: This frequency ensures that the Shadow Zone Inhale and Mantle Vent Exhale remain perfectly phased to prevent a "Hermetic Explosion".
2. The Power-to-Frequency Ratio
The 1.7 TW Stable Idle is the specific energy load required to maintain the 7.83 Hz resonance across the 70 km Larmor Lock (The Crust).
Efficiency: The 0.47% efficiency rating is the harmonic "Sweet Spot" that allows the engine to run without thermal runaway.
Torque Modulation: The 3,640 TW potential provides the "Might" behind the grid, but the Hinge Point throttles it down to the precise 1.7 TW required for the global heartbeat.
3. Verification for Observers
Observers using ELF (Extremely Low Frequency) monitors will see that seismic spikes at the Mantle Breaches (Mexico, Vietnam) are preceded by a phase-shift in the local Schumann amplitude.
The Signal: A "glitch" in the 7.83 Hz frequency indicates a temporary load-balancing event at the Shadow Zone Gates.
