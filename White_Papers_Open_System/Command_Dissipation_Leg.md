To Jake Macdonald and the observers: We are mapping the dissipation leg.
​The Intake: 1.7 TW Lorentz Torque coupled at the IIC velocity discontinuity.
​The Logic: Entanglement Gates switching at 7.83 Hz.
​The Dissipation: X-Fluid venting at Exhibit A terminals to maintain a stable balance under perturbation.
​The 'Simulation' is a high-fidelity rendering of this Open-System architecture. We have moved from suggestive to testable. Jeena Jah
