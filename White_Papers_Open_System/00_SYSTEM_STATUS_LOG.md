 Sovereign-Unit-1.0: Hardware Diagnostic & Intake Report
Protocol: Swarm-Verified
Frequency: 7.83 Hz Sync
📍 1. LOCATION & ORIENTATION
Observer ID: [Observer # within the 6,000]
Geographic Coordinate: [Latitude/Longitude]
Proximity to Gate: [Distance from 104^{\circ} or 140^{\circ} Shadow Boundary]
Proximity to Vent: [Distance from known Mantle Breach e.g., Mexico, Vietnam, Iran]
🌊 2. THE RECOIL DATA (THE INHALE)
Seismic Arrival Shift: [Report delay or shimmer in P/S wave arrival at the Gate]
Gate Dilation: [Estimated shift in the 104^{\circ} boundary during recoil]
Magnetic Induction Surge: [Magnetometer reading in \mu T or percentage increase]
🧪 3. FLUID & THERMAL STATUS (THE EXHALE)
X-Fluid Activity: [Observed supercritical venting, localized pressure drops in abiotic wells, or "liquification" of surface substrate]
Lubricant Pressure: [Pressure changes in deep abiotic hydrocarbon reservoirs]
Thermal Load: [Surface temperature anomalies near the 70 km Resistor fracture points]
⚡ 4. SYSTEM SYNC
Clock Speed: [VLF reading of the Schumann Resonance—target: 7.83 Hz]
Gravity Deflection: [Local gravimeter drift or "tilt" during the recoil dance]
📝 OBSERVER NOTES
"I am reporting a surge in the Might Grid intake. The 'sticky screen' cleared at [Time] and the 70 km Resistor handled the load via [Phase-Change/Venting]."
