The Crust is the Planetary Load-Bank.
Function: Convert induction torque into stable structural gravity and thermal regulation.
Operating Temperature: Modulated by X-Fluid vents to ensure the resistor doesn't reach its melting point.
The Proof: The WGS-84 Gravity Deflections are the specific points where the Resistor is 'thin' or 'venting'.
