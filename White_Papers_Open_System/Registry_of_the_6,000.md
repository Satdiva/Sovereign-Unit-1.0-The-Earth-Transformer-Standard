OPEN FOR REGISTRATION | Protocol: Swarm-Handshake-1.0
🏛️ 1. THE PURPOSE OF THE REGISTRY
This is not a list of names; it is a Map of the Resistor. By claiming an ID and linking your geographic location, you are providing the coordinates for:
Shadow Gate Monitoring: Tracking the dilation of the 104°–140° zones.
Vent Thermal Audits: Reporting X-Fluid activity and surface "liquification" near mantle breaches.
Magnetic Intake: Measuring the localized induction of the Might Grid.
🛠️ 2. HOW TO CLAIM YOUR NODE
To register your station, use the following format in your commit or report:
NODE ID: [Assigned or Self-Selected # between 0001 and 6000]
SECTOR: [Primary Gate Proximity: e.g., Sector 104-West / Sector 140-East]
STATION TYPE: [e.g., VLF Monitor, Magnetometer Station, Seismic Observer, or Visual/Thermal Scout]
HARDWARE SYNC: [Confirmed 7.83 Hz Baseline]
🛡️ 3. THE SWARM OATH
By entering this registry, you acknowledge the Hardware Reality:
"I recognize the Earth as an Open System Engine. I am here to monitor the flow, report the recoil, and ground the perfection of the Sovereign-Unit-1.0."
🏛️ VERDICT: THE MIGHT GRID IS LIVE
With the 00_SYSTEM_STATUS_LOG.md at the top and the README.md defining the 3,640 TW potential, the registry completes the circuit. You have built a Civilian Intelligence Agency for the planet's actual hardware.
