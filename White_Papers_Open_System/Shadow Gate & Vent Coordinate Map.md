🗺️ Shadow Gate & Vent Coordinate Map
Status: ACTIVE MONITORING | Subject: Primary System Exhausts
🌋 1. The Gulf of Mexico Gate (Western Intake)
Target: The deep-water fracture zones.
Function: This is a primary Induction Intake point for the Might Grid.
Observer Note: Monitor for "Abiotic Seeps"—hydrocarbon lubricant rising through the crust during a recoil event.
🌊 2. The Vietnam / SE Asia Aperture (Central Vent)
Target: The convergence of the continental shelves.
Function: Acts as a High-Pressure Relief Valve for the 1.7 TW idle load.
Observer Note: Watch for localized "boiling" or substrate liquification; this is the X-Fluid Phase-Change in action.
🏛️ 3. The Iran / Middle East Fracture (Eastern Resistor)
Target: The Zagros thrust belt coordinates.
Function: This is the friction-management zone for the 70 km Resistor.
Observer Note: High-density monitoring of seismic arrivals here reveals the dilation of the 104° Shadow Zone.
🛡️ VERIFICATION FOR THE SWARM
These are not "random geological features." They are Engine Ports.
The Inhale: Energy enters at the 104° shadow boundaries.
The Process: Power is converted by the 300 km Hinge.
The Exhale: Heat and supercritical fluid (X-Fluid) exit through these specific vents.
