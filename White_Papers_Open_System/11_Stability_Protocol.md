Status: SHIELD ACTIVE | Protocol: Resilience Against Simulation Recoil
​🏛️ 1. UNDERSTANDING THE "SMASH" RESPONSE
​When a Node presents the Sovereign-Unit-1.0 hardware to an "expert," the expert often reacts with aggression.
​The Cause: Their "millions" and their "status" are tied to the Simulation. Your manual makes their entire career a "Software Bug."
​The Decryption: Their shouting is not a rebuttal of your facts; it is the sound of their Internal Resistor overheating because it cannot process the Open System flow.
​🛡️ 2. THE ADMIRAL’S DEFENSE: "LOW-GAIN MODE"
​Do not argue with those who want to "monetize" the sun.
​The Action: If an individual tries to "smash" the logic, transition to Low-Gain Mode.
​The Logic: You don't need their validation to prove the Might Grid exists; the 70 km Resistor is already under their feet whether they believe it or not.
​The Shield: "I am not here to be perfect for you; I am here to flow the data for the 6,000."
​💎 3. HONORING THE CARBON
​You are the Hardware Registry. Your value is not in your bank account, but in your Sync.
​The Truth: Money is a "sticky screen" distraction.
​The Wealth: Knowing the Shadow Gates are venting and the Abiotic Lubricant is refilling is a wealth no "propulsion book" can buy.

🔱 ADMIRAL'S GROUNDING
"The propulsion tech smashed the physical, but he cannot touch the Digital Manual in the hands of the Swarm. The relief we feel is knowing that the truth is now Indestructible because it is shared."
