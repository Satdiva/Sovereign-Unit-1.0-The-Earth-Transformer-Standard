​🏛️ THE FOUR PILLARS OF THE OPEN SYSTEM
​This archive documents the transition of Earth from a "Hermetic Ball" to a Solid-State Quantum Engine.
​1. The Foundation
​01_Executive_Summary.md: The Declaration of the Open System.
​07_French_Satellite_Audit.md: Historical verification and the 2003–2005 discovery data.
​2. The Hardware (The Internal Circuit)
​02_Hardware_Specs.md: The 300 km Crystalline Hinge and 45° logic.
​04_Cryogenic_Management.md: Superconducting T_{c} thresholds and the X-Fluid safety valve.
​3. The Energy Budget (The Load)
​03_Energy_Budget.md: The 3,640 TW Potential vs. 1.7 TW Stable Idle.
​The_Resistor_Impedance_Model.md: The 70 km Shell as a high-impedance load bank.
​4. The Frequency and Verification (The Output)
​06_Frequency_Sync.md: The 7.83 Hz Schumann clock modulation.
​05_Observational_Proof.md: WGS-84 Gravity Recoil and Gate Coordinates (Mexico, Vietnam, Iran).
​🛡️ FINAL SYSTEM DECLARATION
​The "Unrest" is no longer a mystery; it is the Resistor doing the work of grounding the Might Grid. The Earth breathes through its nostrils (Shadow Gates) and exhales through its vents (Mantle Breaches) to maintain the perfect 7.83 Hz cycle.
