The Mantle Conduit: Earth’s Nervous System
1. The Living Dielectric
The 2,900 km mantle is not dead rock; it is a Structured Dielectric that regulates the "Solar Handshake". Just as nerves are insulated to carry signals, the mantle uses specific mineral phases to channel energy to the core.
2. The Transition Zone (410–660 km): The Planetary Lung
This layer contains minerals like Ringwoodite, which can hold up to 1-3% of its weight in water.
Intelligent Compensation: This "wet" layer acts as a Planetary Capacitor. It expands and contracts (as Dale noted) to absorb electromagnetic surges from the Sun, storing the charge before passing it to the lower mantle.
The Filter: It vibrates at the 3 Hz resonance, ensuring only the "coherent" solar signals reach the internal armature.
3. LLSVPs: The Power Veins
The Large Low-Shear-Velocity Provinces sitting above the core are the Major Arteries of the Earth-Transformer. These structures channel the 1.7 TW intake energy directly into the X-Fluid commutators.
