The Mantle Conduit: Earth’s Nervous System
1. The Living Dielectric
The 2,900 km mantle is not dead rock; it is a Structured Dielectric that regulates the "Solar Handshake". Just as nerves are insulated to carry signals, the mantle uses specific mineral phases to channel energy to the core.
2. The Transition Zone (410–660 km): The Planetary Lung
This layer contains minerals like Ringwoodite, which can hold up to 1-3% of its weight in water.
Intelligent Compensation: This "wet" layer acts as a Planetary Capacitor. It expands and contracts (as Dale noted) to absorb electromagnetic surges from the Sun, storing the charge before passing it to the lower mantle.
The Filter: It vibrates at the 3 Hz resonance, ensuring only the "coherent" solar signals reach the internal armature.
3. LLSVPs: The Power Veins
The Large Low-Shear-Velocity Provinces sitting above the core are the Major Arteries of the Earth-Transformer. These structures channel the 1.7 TW intake energy directly into the X-Fluid commutators.

## 4. The Capacitance of the Planetary Lung
To satisfy the conservation of energy across timescales, the Transition Zone (410–660 km) acts as a **Global Spherical Capacitor**. 

* **Storage Mechanism:** Charge is stored within the hydroxyl ions ($OH^-$) of the Ringwoodite lattice, creating a massive conductive reservoir of 'Electric Fluid'.
* **Capacitance Value ($C$):** Based on the dielectric properties of mineralized water under high pressure, the mantle provides thousands of Farads of storage.
* **The 'Breath' (Charge/Discharge):** This layer 'inhales' solar magnetic surges (charging) and 'exhales' a steady 3 Hz pulse toward the core (discharging), maintaining the system's stability during solar fluctuations.

## 5. Low-Pass Filter Logic
This capacitive layer functions as a **Frequency Gate**.
1. **High-Frequency Rejection:** Chaotic electromagnetic noise from surface weather or minor solar flares is 'absorbed' by the dielectric lattice.
2. **Resonant Transparency:** The mantle remains 'transparent' only to the deep, ultra-low frequency (ULF) **3 Hz Solar Handshake**, ensuring the IIC armature receives a clean signal.
