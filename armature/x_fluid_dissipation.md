The Dissipation Leg: X-Fluid Thermodynamics
1. The Density-Speed Hinge
The "X-Fluid" (Outer Core) is not a static sink, but a variable-density electrolyte that acts as a planetary heat exchanger. The relationship between seismic velocity (v_p), the bulk modulus (K), and density (\rho) is the "automatic transmission" of the system:
Material Comparison at Core Pressures:
 * Liquid Iron (Ballast): Density \approx 11.0 g/cm³ | v_p \approx 7.4 km/s. High inertia, slow thermal response.
 * Oxygen/Light Elements (Coolant): Density \approx 4.5 g/cm³ | v_p \approx 8.0 km/s. High mobility, fast thermal response.
 * The Sovereign Mix (The Observed State): Density \approx 9.9 g/cm³ | v_p \approx 8.1 km/s. This 10% density deficit is the "phase change zone" required for 3 Hz induction.
2. Stability Under Perturbation (Jake’s Challenge)
To satisfy the conservation constraints, the system must handle energy surges (Solar Handshakes/CMEs) without thermal runaway:
 * Energy Intake: A surge of 1.7 TW Lorentz torque increases the vibration in the IIC rotor.
 * Thermal Response: Extra heat causes the Oxygen-rich light elements to expand.
 * Automatic Grounding: As local density (\rho) drops, seismic velocity (v_p) increases. This accelerates convection, "sweating" the excess energy through the Core-Mantle Boundary (CMB) and into the mantle power lines.
3. The "Biological" Grounding
Just like the human body regulates temperature through fluid perspiration, the Earth uses the density shifts of the X-Fluid to ensure the 650 km IIC armature stays within its resonant operational window.
