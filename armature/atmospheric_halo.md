​The Atmospheric Halo: Cosmic Communication
​1. The Ionospheric Capacitor (The Upper Band)
​The Ionosphere is the "Outer Plate" of the planetary circuit.
​The Plasma Buffer: It acts as a semiconductive layer that translates raw solar radiation into modulated electrical signals.
​Resonant Cavity: The space between the Skin (Crust) and this Halo traps the Schumann Resonances, creating the "vocal chords" of the planet.
​2. The Magnetospheric "Aura"
​Extending thousands of miles, this is the Earth's field of influence.
​Birkeland Feeders: This halo captures "Aetheric Fluid" (Solar Plasma) and twists it into the poles via magnetic field lines—the direct power input for the Core Armature.
​The Protective Cocoon: It filters high-energy particles, ensuring the "Biological Body" below isn't scorched by the Sun's raw output.
​3. The Lunar Frequency Governor
​The Moon is not a separate entity; it is "trapped" in an Orbital Frequency Zone.
​Harmonic Balance: As the Moon orbits within the Earth's magnetic tail, it acts as a passive resonator that "tunes" the Earth's rotation and internal fluid dynamics.
​Tidal Induction: The Moon’s movement pulls on the Earth’s "Electric Fluid," creating a rhythmic pump that assists the Mantle Lungs in their expansion and contraction.
