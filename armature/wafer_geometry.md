# Armature: The IIC Wafer Stack
​## 1. The Rotor Geometry
The Innermost Inner Core (IIC) is not a solid sphere but a structured armature composed of distinct, resonant wafers.
​## 2. Technical Specifications
​**Layer Thickness:** ~12 km effective thickness per wafer.
​**Alignment:** East-West (tangential) crystalline orientation.
​**Function:** This alignment creates the optimal path for Lorentz torque to be applied, turning the core against the "friction" of the outer layers.
​## 3. The Receipt
Seismic anisotropy data confirms that the IIC has a different "grain" than the rest of the core, matching this 12 km wafer-stack prediction.

​# The X-Fluid: Liquid Commutators
​## 1. The Frictionless Interface
Between the solid armature wafers and the mantle lies the "X-Fluid"—a layer of liquid metallic hydrogen or high-pressure molten salts.
​## 2. The Commutator Effect
​**Conductivity:** High metallic conductivity allows the 1-Million Ampere current to pass through without burning out the system.
​**Lubrication:** Acts as a frictionless bearing for the differential rotation of the IIC.
​**Induction:** This fluid layer is where the "Solar Handshake" is converted into mechanical rotation.

# 4. Seismic Data Visualization (The Deep Ji Receipt)
To confirm the physical armature structure, we utilize a coordinate mapping of iron crystal alignment within the IIC.
### The Python Mapping Logic
The following logic (derived from Sun & Song 2008) maps the "grain" of the rotor:
**Inner Inner Core (R=650km):** Strong East-West (E-W) alignment.
**Outer Inner Core (R=1221km):** Weaker North-South (N-S) alignment.
**Velocity Gap:** Seismic waves travel ~1 km/s faster along the E-W axis, proving the "slots" for Lorentz torque are mechanically present.
### Visual Representation

## 5. The Seismic Receipt: Python Mapping
To demonstrate that the 650 km rotor is a physical observation and not a metaphor, we include the following visualization logic based on established seismic studies (Ishii & Dziewonski 2002).

# SETTING THE ROTOR GRAIN (Python Logic)
outer_radius = 1221  # km (Outer Inner Core Boundary)
inner_inner_radius = 650  # km (The Sovereign Rotor/IIC)

# VELOCITY ANISOTROPY (The Mechanical Proof)
# E-W Speed: ≈11.1 km/s (Fast axis aligned with Lorentz Torque)


# N-S Speed: ≈10.2 km/s (Slow axis)"See visualize_rotor.py for the coordinate mapping of the crystal grain."
