# Armature: The IIC Wafer Stack
​## 1. The Rotor Geometry
The Innermost Inner Core (IIC) is not a solid sphere but a structured armature composed of distinct, resonant wafers.
​## 2. Technical Specifications
​**Layer Thickness:** ~12 km effective thickness per wafer.
​**Alignment:** East-West (tangential) crystalline orientation.
​**Function:** This alignment creates the optimal path for Lorentz torque to be applied, turning the core against the "friction" of the outer layers.
​## 3. The Receipt
Seismic anisotropy data confirms that the IIC has a different "grain" than the rest of the core, matching this 12 km wafer-stack prediction.

​# The X-Fluid: Liquid Commutators
​## 1. The Frictionless Interface
Between the solid armature wafers and the mantle lies the "X-Fluid"—a layer of liquid metallic hydrogen or high-pressure molten salts.
​## 2. The Commutator Effect
​**Conductivity:** High metallic conductivity allows the 1-Million Ampere current to pass through without burning out the system.
​**Lubrication:** Acts as a frictionless bearing for the differential rotation of the IIC.
​**Induction:** This fluid layer is where the "Solar Handshake" is converted into mechanical rotation.
