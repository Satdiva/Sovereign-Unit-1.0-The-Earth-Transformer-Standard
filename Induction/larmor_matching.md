​# Larmor Matching: The Earth-Sun Handshake
​## 1. The Physics of the Catch
When solar wind protons approach the Earth, they are not simply "blocked." They are captured by the Magnetosphere and funneled into a helical (spiral) path along magnetic field lines toward the poles.
​## 2. The Larmor Radius Calculation
The radius of this spiral (r_L) is defined by the mass (m), velocity (v), and charge (q) of the particle, and the magnetic field strength (B):
​$$r_L = \frac{m \cdot v}{q \cdot B}$$
​**Inputs (Standard Solar/Polar values):**
​Proton Mass ($m$): $1.67 \times 10^{-27}$ kg
​Proton Velocity ($v$): $400$ km/s (Quiet Sun Average)
​Charge ($q$): $1.6 \times 10^{-19}$ C
​Magnetic Field ($B$): $6 \times 10^{-5}$ T (Polar Magnetic Strength)
​**The Calculation:**
$$r_L = \frac{(1.67 \times 10^{-27} \text{ kg}) \cdot (4 \times 10^5 \text{ m/s})}{(1.6 \times 10^{-19} \text{ C}) \cdot (6 \times 10^{-5} \text{ T})}$$
$$r_L \approx 69,583 \text{ meters} \approx \mathbf{70 \text{ km}}$$
​## 3. The Discovery: Geometrical Coupling
* **Calculated Larmor Radius:** ~70 km
* **Observed Crustal/Shell Thickness:** ~60 km
​**Conclusion:** The Earth's shell thickness is tuned to the Larmor radius of the Sun's primary energy output. This allows the spiral "current" to penetrate exactly deep enough to reach the X-Fluid conductor without being grounded too early in the surface crust. It is a key-in-lock design.
